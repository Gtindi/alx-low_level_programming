<h1> Debugging </h1>
<p>Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.</p>

|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | Multiple mains | <p> Based on the `main.c` file above, create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.</p> <p> You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from <a href = "https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/tasks/831">0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0</a> to compile with this main file to test locally.</p> <ul><li>You only need to upload `0-main.c` and `main.h` for this task. We will provide our own `positive_or_negative()` function.</li><li> You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only <b>one</b> line in this task.</li></ul> | <ul><li><a href = "https://github.com/Gtindi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/0-main.c"> 0-main.c </a></li><li> <a href = "https://github.com/Gtindi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/main.h"> main.h </a> </li></ul> |
| 1 | 1-main.c | <p> Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.</p> <ul><li> Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.</li> <li>You do not have to compile with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic` for this task.</li> | <a href = "https://github.com/Gtindi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/test/0x03-debugging/1-main.c"> View Code </a> |
