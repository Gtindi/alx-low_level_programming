|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | 0-positive_or_negative.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative. <ul><li> You can find the source code <a href = "https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c"> here </a> </li><li> The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program </li><li> You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code </li><li> The output of the program should be:<ul><li> The number, followed by </li> <ul><li> if the number is greater than 0: `is positive` </li><li> if the number is 0: `is zero` </li><li> if the number is less than 0: `is negative` </li></ul> <li> followed by a new line </li></ul> </ul> | <A href = "https://github.com/Gtindi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c"> View Code </a> |
| 1 | 1-last_digit.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`. <ul><li> The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program </li><li> You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, and `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code </li><Li> The output of the program should be: </li> <ul><li> The string `Last digit of`, followed by </li><li> `n`, followed by </li><li> the string `is`, followed by </li> <ul><li> if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5` </li><li> if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0` </li><li> if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0` </li></ul> <li> followed by a new line</li></ul> </ul> | <a href = "https://github.com/Gtindi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c"> View Code </a> |
