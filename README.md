<h1> C - Low Level Programming </h1>
<p> A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language.</p>
<p> C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.It is a very popular language, despite being old.C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>
