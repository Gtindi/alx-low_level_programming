<h1> C Programming Language </h1>
<h2> Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming </h2>
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School.In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:
